Add a “Save as Inspiration” button in the extension popup when viewing a post on X or Instagram.

Store saved posts (text, image URL, and metadata like platform and date) on the server, linked to the user’s account.

Ensure compliance with platform terms (e.g., Instagram’s API restrictions) by saving only publicly available post data.

4.4.2. Make This More [Adjective]
Description: Allows users to specify an adjective (e.g., “witty,” “heartfelt,” “bold”) to receive AI suggestions for adjusting the post’s tone or style to match that adjective.

Functionality:
In the suggestion box, users select “Make This More…” and input an adjective via a text field or choose from a preset list (e.g., “Witty,” “Inspirational,” “Professional”).

The AI provides suggestions to rewrite the post to align with the chosen adjective, such as alternative phrasing, word choices, or emojis.

Users can optionally include inspiration posts to guide the tone adjustment (e.g., “Make this more witty like [saved post]”).

Suggestions are previewed in the suggestion box, with one-click apply or manual edit options.

Functionality:
Users can select a post (their own or another public post) via the extension popup by clicking “Analyze This Post.”

The AI analyzes the post’s text, tone, structure, hashtags, and (if available) engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments, shares) to determine what worked or didn’t.

Results are displayed in the extension popup, including:
A summary of the post’s performance (e.g., “High engagement due to strong CTA and trending hashtags”).

Specific factors (e.g., “Short sentences increased readability on X,” “Lack of hashtags reduced discoverability on Instagram”).

Recommendations for future posts based on the analysis.

For the user’s own posts, WordWise can pull engagement data via API integration (if connected) for more accurate analysis.

Implementation:
Add an “Analyze This Post” button in the extension popup when viewing a post on X or Instagram.

Upon clicking, the AI provides:
A detailed analysis of the post’s strengths and weaknesses (e.g., engagement potential, clarity, tone alignment).

Specific suggestions to enhance engagement, such as stronger CTAs, better hashtag placement, or structural changes (e.g., shorter sentences for X).

If inspiration posts are selected, the AI incorporates their style, tone, or structure into suggestions (e.g., “Mimic the conversational tone of [saved post]”).

Suggestions are categorized (e.g., “Engagement,” “Structure,” “Hashtags”) and can be applied with one click.

Implementation:
Add an “Improve This Post” option in the suggestion box, with a sub-menu to select inspiration posts from the user’s library (optional).

Users can input keywords or descriptors (e.g., “Make a joke,” “Tell a story,” “Inspirational”) to guide the caption’s tone or style.

The AI analyzes the image (using image recognition) and generates 2-3 caption options, displayed in the suggestion box.

Users can select a caption to apply directly to the post or edit it manually.
