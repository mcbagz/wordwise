Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Title: Chrome Extension for Content Creators: Grammar, Tone, Style, and SEO Assistant
Version: 1.0

1. Introduction
Purpose: This PRD outlines the requirements for a Chrome extension designed to assist content creators on X, Instagram, and YouTube by providing real-time suggestions for grammar, tone, style, and SEO. The extension aims to enhance content quality, engagement, and discoverability, addressing the needs of users like Sarah, Jamal, Maya, Liam, Priya, and Ethan.
Scope: The extension will:
Monitor text input in X (post composer), Instagram (caption field), and YouTube (title, description, tags).

Provide real-time suggestions for grammar (correctness), tone (platform-appropriate emotion), style (clarity and impact), and SEO (keywords and hashtags).

Operate as a hybrid system with lightweight client-side processing and server-side AI/NLP analysis.

Be intuitive, non-intrusive, and tailored to each platform’s unique requirements.

Target Audience: Content creators (e.g., bloggers, influencers, vloggers) who create text-based content on X, Instagram, and YouTube.
2. Goals and Objectives
User Goals:
Improve content quality with accurate grammar and polished style.

Align tone with platform expectations (e.g., witty for X, inspiring for Instagram, informative for YouTube).

Boost discoverability through SEO-optimized keywords and hashtags.

Enhance productivity with real-time, non-disruptive suggestions.

Business Goals:
Deliver a valuable tool to differentiate from competitors like Grammarly.

Support a freemium model with basic features free and advanced features (e.g., custom tone profiles) premium.

Build a scalable, secure system to handle growing user bases.

3. Functional Requirements
The extension will consist of client-side (Chrome extension) and server-side components, with clear delineation of responsibilities.
3.1 Client-Side Functional Requirements (Chrome Extension)
Text Capture:
Detect and monitor text input in:
X: Post composer field.

Instagram: Caption field.

YouTube: Title, description, and tags fields.

Use content scripts to target platform-specific DOM elements (e.g., <textarea> or contenteditable).

Capture text changes in real time via input or DOM mutation events.

Send platform metadata (e.g., “platform: YouTube, field: description”) with API requests.

User Interface:
Display suggestions via:
Inline underlines for grammar errors (e.g., red for misspellings).

Pop-ups for tone and style suggestions (e.g., “Replace ‘good’ with ‘compelling’ for impact”).

Sidebar for SEO suggestions (e.g., “Add #TravelBlogger for Instagram”).

Ensure UI is compact for Instagram, detailed for YouTube, and minimal for X.

Allow users to accept/reject suggestions with a click or keyboard shortcut.

Provide a settings popup (via extension icon) to toggle suggestion types (grammar, tone, style, SEO) and set tone preferences (e.g., witty, professional).

Local Preprocessing:
Perform lightweight checks:
Grammar: Basic regex for common errors (e.g., double spaces, “your” vs. “you’re”).

SEO: Enforce character limits (e.g., 280 for X, 2,200 for Instagram captions, 5,000 for YouTube descriptions).

Tone/Style: Cache user preferences to filter suggestions locally.

Store settings using chrome.storage for persistence and sync.

API Communication:
Send text and metadata to the server via HTTPS fetch or WebSocket for real-time analysis.

Receive and parse JSON responses containing suggestions.

Handle intermittent connectivity with cached suggestions or error messages.

Event Handling:
Respond to user interactions (e.g., accept suggestion, hover for details).

Ensure compatibility with platform-specific shortcuts (e.g., X’s post button).

3.2 Server-Side Functional Requirements
Grammar Analysis:
Analyze text for spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors (e.g., subject-verb agreement, misplaced commas).

Use rule-based systems for deterministic checks and NLP models (e.g., BERT) for context-aware corrections.

Tailor strictness to platform (e.g., conversational for X, polished for YouTube).

Tone Analysis:
Detect tone (e.g., casual, professional, inspiring) using sentiment analysis or text classification models.

Suggest adjustments based on user preferences and platform norms (e.g., witty for X, motivational for Instagram).

Support user-defined tone goals (e.g., “always engaging”).

Style Analysis:
Enhance clarity, conciseness, and impact (e.g., suggest active voice, shorter synonyms).

Use NLP models to evaluate sentence structure and word choice.

Align suggestions with platform needs (e.g., short sentences for X/Instagram, structured text for YouTube).

SEO Optimization:
Suggest platform-specific keywords and hashtags:
X: Trending hashtags/topics based on real-time trends.

Instagram: Niche hashtags (e.g., #FitnessMotivation) and optimal counts (5-10).

YouTube: Search-optimized keywords for titles/descriptions, leveraging YouTube Data API or trend data.

Analyze keyword density and relevance.

Maintain a database of SEO best practices per platform.

Context Detection:
Identify platform and content type from metadata (e.g., URL, field type).

Adjust suggestion logic based on context (e.g., short-form for X, long-form for YouTube).

User Data Management:
Store user preferences (e.g., tone, ignored suggestion types) in a secure cloud database.

Support custom dictionaries or brand voice guidelines.

Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance with minimal data retention.

3.3 Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:
Client: Minimal resource usage (<50MB memory, low CPU impact).

Server: <200ms latency for suggestion delivery.

Handle 1,000 concurrent users with scalable cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS Lambda).

Security:
Encrypt API calls (TLS) and data at rest.

Avoid processing sensitive fields (e.g., passwords).

Provide a clear privacy policy.

Compatibility:
Support Chrome (latest stable version) on desktop.

Ensure functionality across X, Instagram, and YouTube (desktop and web-based mobile views).

Handle dynamic UI changes (e.g., React-based Instagram).

Reliability:
Gracefully handle server downtime with cached suggestions or error messages.

Ensure 99.9% uptime for server-side services.

4. User Stories
The extension addresses the following user needs:
Sarah (X): Real-time suggestions for concise, engaging posts with trending hashtags.

5. Assumptions and Constraints
Assumptions:
Users have stable internet for server-side processing.

Platforms allow text field monitoring via content scripts.

Access to NLP libraries or APIs for grammar/tone/style analysis.

Constraints:
Limited to Chrome browser for initial release.

Dependent on platform APIs (e.g., YouTube Data API) for SEO, subject to rate limits.

Server-side costs must be manageable for freemium model.

6. MVP Scope
